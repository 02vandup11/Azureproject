Overview: 
  Our e-commerce platform seamlessly integrates various Azure components to deliver a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly experience. Azure VMs host our platform, providing scalable computing power to handle user traffic and workload fluctuations effectively. Azure monitoring services track system performance and user interactions in real-time, logging and monitoring operations for performance and security. These events trigger alerts via email or SMS to keep stakeholders informed. Azure's backup and restore services ensure the safety of our data with regular backups and quick restoration options. Azure file shares facilitate seamless collaboration among team members, while Azure Log Analytics offers valuable insights into system behaviour and user activity. An AI-powered chatbot enhances customer support, reducing the workload on human agents and improving overall efficiency and customer satisfaction. This integration ensures operational excellence, data security, and enhanced user engagement, with a monitoring and notification system providing timely alerts for critical actions, enabling proactive response and ensuring a smooth user experience.

            a.	Definition: Specialized storage locations used for securely storing backup data.
            b.	Role: Provides a secure and reliable repository for backup data of your VMs.

7.	Storage Account Container
    1.	Definition: A container within a storage account is a grouping of blobs (binary large objects), which can store unstructured data like text or binary data.
    2.	Role: Organizes and manages the storage of data used by your AI services.

8.	Storage Account with Soft Delete, Change the Date of Soft Delete, and Versioning
       1.	Storage Account:
              a.	Definition: A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data objects.
              b.	Role: Houses all your Azure Storage data objects, including blobs, file shares, queues, and tables.
     2.	Soft Delete:
              a.	Definition: A feature that temporarily retains deleted data, allowing recovery within a specified retention period.
              b.	Role: Protects against accidental deletions by allowing you to restore deleted data.
       3.	Change the Date of Soft Delete:
              a.	Definition: Adjusting the retention period for softdeleted data.
              b.	Role: Gives you flexibility in managing how long deleted data is retained.
        4.	Versioning:
              a.	Definition: A feature that maintains previous versions of data objects, enabling recovery of earlier versions.
